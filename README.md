MySQL. The database consists of matchup and owner data pulled from a public ESPN fantasy football league.\
The React frontend manipulates this data to provide meaningful insight into the various stats, figures, and records\
from all years of history within the league. 

## Development Build

## Production Build

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
